### The world's greatest url ~~shortener~~ disguiser
Your friend just pranked you - sent you an empty repl after weeks of blabbering about it "being the best game in the world". What do you do? Seek revenge, Rickroll them. How? Using my app, `kewurl`. `kewurl` is a reveloutionary app that makes the sacred art of _rickrolling_ easier. 
## How to use
First of all, fork the repl (and therefore in ANY PUBLIC PROJECT'S MARKDOWN/DESCRIPTION YOU MUST GIVE CREDIT TO ME IN AT LEAST A ##. An italised ### will also work.)! Next, go to the `shell` tab and type:
```sh
python3 help/help-to-disguise/name-gen.py
```
This generates a random character. Set the repl name to that random character, OK (what this does is it fools somebody who has fallen for the prank before)? Next, set the variable `burl` (stands for **b**ase **url**) to the title of the repl. Refresh the page. Once everything reloads, run the program (with the run button) and wait for `dep.sh` (my package installer) and `flask` to load. Open the website in a new tab. Type the rickroll link into the input box, then click `Shorten`. You should go to a page that tells you the disguised link. That link is almost UNhackable. 

## fun stuff
A constant redirect creates the funniest effect - click [here] (https://kewurl.amoghthecool.repl.co/21). It's almost like the url is ticking down to 10. 

## Credits
- Me for 100% of the code.
- @CoolCoderSJ for the inspiration from `SJurl`. In case you didn't know, this project started out as a url shortener. 
- `dillinger.io` for the markdown-to-html transition.
# Happy RickRolling! 
> Note: DO NOT TRY TO RICKROLL ME. Any links sent to me will be checked -- not that I would tell you how to check a link... it's almost funny to watch someone clicking so gullibly on a RickRoll....
